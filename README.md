# sfdc-ci-toolkit
CI Scripts for Salesforce projects

This repository purpose is to centralized Continuous Integration scripts dedicated to the Salesforce platform.
It allows you to build your app, sanitized your repository (profile and permission sets) and automate things for you.
It has been designed and built to be fast, modular and to run with just npm as dependencies.

You can make it run into a basic alpine-node docker image.
You can easily add a tasks to this script for your own needs.

Compatible and complementary to SalesforceDX


## Getting Started

Works in Unix like system.
Windows is not tested.

### Installing

```
$ cd /your/sfdc/repo
$ git clone https://github.com/scolladon/sfdc-ci-toolkit.git
# Or :
$ wget http://github.com/scolladon/sfdc-ci-toolkit/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip

# Then :
$ npm install
```
then you can either remove .git folder or add it as a submodule of your sfdc repo

### Tasks prepackaged

SFDC-ci-toolkit comes with handy npm scripts for CI :
```javascript
"scripts": {
  "full-build": "npm run deploy",
  "postfull-build": "npm run move-tag",
  "predeploy": "gulp pre-deploy-script",
  "deploy": "gulp deploy",
  "postdeploy": "gulp post-deploy-script",
  "partial-package": "gulp prepare-package",
  "move-tag": "./movetag.sh",
  "partial-build": "npm run partial-package",
  "postpartial-build": "npm run deploy",
  "coverage": "gulp coverage",
  "profile-completion": "gulp profile-completion",
  "profile-reconciliation": "gulp profile-reconciliation",
  "generate-package": "gulp generate-package",
  "generate-data-dictionary": "gulp generate-data-dictionary",
  "display-coverage": "gulp read-coverage"
}
```
Combined them smartly according to your need as a developer or as a release manager ;)

Here is the list of scripts with their description available in the toolkit
* **coverage** : Run it just after having deployed with the RunLocalTests. It will gather the coverage and translate it to lcov format into coverage.json file
* **deploy** : Run it to deploy your repo to Salesforce
* **generate-package** : Run it to generate your package.xml from your repository
* **generate-data-dictionary** : Run it to generate your data dictionary from your Salesforce org
* **pre-deploy-script** : Run it to run execute anonymous each script files contained into PRE_SCRIPT_PATH variable
* **post-deploy-script** : Run it to run execute anonymous each script files contained into POST_SCRIPT_PATH variable
* **prepare-package** : Run it to generate package.xml and destructiveChanges.xml by diffing the HEAD commit and the commit sha into COMMIT variable
* **prepare-runtests** : Run it to generate SF_RUNTESTS based on the src/classes folder and the SF_TESTSUFFIX variable
* **profile-completion** : Run it to complete your non admin profiles & permission sets with the removed user permissions
* **profile-reconciliation** : Run it to check the consistency of your repo and the profiles & permission sets definition into it
* **display-coverage** : Run it after having deploy with test runned. It will display the code coverage.

## Usage Example
Let's imagine you finalized the three first steps of [building a Conference Management app](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/projects/salesforce_developer_workshop/steps/creating_apex_class) in your sandbox and you want to deploy it to your dev org!
First add the toolbox into your repo

```
$ cd /your/repo/path
$ wget http://github.com/scolladon/sfdc-ci-toolkit/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip -d sfdc-ci-toolkit
```

add sfdc-ci-toolkit to your gitignore and configure the toolbox (cf Configuration)
Then you go to your repository and fetch the objects, the applications, the tabs, the classes and the profiles (field, tab and class access) metadata definition using your favorite ide
Then you stage and commit your changes to the repo
```
$ git add src/objects/*
$ git add src/applications/*
$ git add src/tabss/*
$ git add src/classes/EmailManager*
$ git add src/profiles/*
$ git commit -m 'Conference Management app thirs step cleared :rocket:'
```

then you will probably complete your profile so your run the profile-completion task :
```
$ npm run profile-completion # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp profile-completion
```

then you will probably check for inconsistency between your profile and the repository so your run the profile-reconciliation task :
```
$ npm run profile-reconciliation # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp profile-reconciliation
```

Then make your changes and staged everything into your repo
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'profile alignment'
```

Then you want to generate your package.xml.
Two way !
* **Full** :
```
$ npm run generate-package # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp generate-package
$ git add src/package.xml
$ git commit -m 'package creation'
```

* **Incremental** : select the commit sha from which you want to compare and put it into a COMMIT variable into the .env file (you can use the CURRENT_BRANCH and COMPARE_BRANCH)
```
$ npm run partial-package # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp prepare-package
$ git add src/package.xml src/destructive*
$ git commit -m 'package creation'
```

Then you want to prepare the test to execute to allow you to have a lightning fast deployment using Specified Test.
edit the SF_TESTSUFFIX variable int the .env file with your test suffix
```
$ npm run prepare-runtests # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp prepare-runtests
```
Then edit the SF_TESTLEVEL variable int the .env file with the value 'RunSpecifiedTests'

Now you are ready to deploy !
Package your pre and post script into the folders configured into POST_SCRIPT_PATH and PRE_SCRIPT_PATH variables.
Execute your pre deploy scripts
```
$ npm run predeploy # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp pre-deploy-script
```

You are going to try the build before merging your dev. So, put the value 'true' into the SF_CHECKONLY variable into the .env file and :
```
$ gulp deploy
```

Execute your post deploy scripts
```
$ npm run postdeploy # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp post-deploy-script
```

If you want to fetch the coverage from the deployment (works better with a RunLocalTests) execute this command :
```
$ npm run coverage # Or if you have gulp globally installed: $ gulp coverage
```
you will get a the coverage to the lcov format in the file 'coverage.json' into the sfdc-ci-toolkit folder

You are ready to package your branch and merge it where you want (follow you development process) !
After having merged the dev, you are ready to deploy. Change the SF_CHECKONLY to false.
You can launch a prepackaged script to automate those operations :
* gulp gulp pre-deploy-script
* gulp deploy
* gulp gulp post-deploy-script
by executing :
```
$ npm run deploy
```
